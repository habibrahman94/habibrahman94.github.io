                    Virtual assistants like Google Assistant, Siri, Cortana, and many others, are now the major feature of smartphones and tablets. Natural language understanding is the most promising part of those. Besides question and answering, sometimes those smart assistants face verbally stated mathematical problems. Algebraic word problems are one of the fundamental mathematical problems where financial news, election results, sports results, and many other services are also related. In this paper, we have generated solutions of the algebraic word problems. Semantic parsing is used to ground the problem text into containers, quantities, and entities to generate equation trees. From the equation trees, features are extracted to train a local and a global classifier model. After that, to find the candidate equation from the generated equation, probabilistic scores from the local and the global classifier models have used.

                    Human sentiments, the attitudes, thoughts, or the judgments backed by feelings are the most important factors for the field of science and business which can be expressed through the web. The rapid growth of unstructured sentiment data has created a very big challenge to provide a fast and cost-efficient model for sentiment analysis. The aim of this research is to find positive and negative emotions from the public comments.
